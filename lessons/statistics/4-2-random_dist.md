[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform

Answer: The distribution is uniform becase the PMF is a horizontal line (same prob for all values) and the CDF is linear with slope = 1


Code:
```{python}
sample = np.random.random(1000)


pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')


cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')


```
